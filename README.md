# GAN Project
This repo contains 3 GAN notebooks (GAN, DCGAN & WGAN) which were created with Google Colab. 
All the notebooks have the same structure:
* Setup: needed packages to launch the notebook.
* Loading data: MNIST dataset from torchvision
* Models: Generator, Discriminator and other support functions
* Training: as in the papers
* Visualisation: for better results, change the number of epochs to 200 or more.
* Summary: learned lessons and useful links.
